Intro to ShopKeepCSV:

An importer/exporter product, currently scoped to receive a particular category of data, in CSV format, converting and exporting it to a JSON file.



Technologies:

The platform was built using Ruby.



Executing Conversions:

Conversions are made by setting the required variables in importer_exporter.rb, the file is then run through the Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB), with, for ease of use, relevant messages being output in the Ruby Shell too.



Write-Up / Brief on Product Design:

A PDF document, outlining the design process, current functionality, scope for future functionality, and the requirements to implement such, can be found in write_up.pdf. It also outines the assumptions made on the sample CSV document provided.
